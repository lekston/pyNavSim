HOW TO START?

- launch ipython console from root
- call:
    execfile('./example/ex_00.py')

- for restaring the simulation:
    basic_aircraft.reset_fpl() # (ex_00)
        or
    ac.reset_fpl()             # (ex_01)

ACCESS to LOGGED DATA:

- after first run of the simulation, log data area available via:
    sim.log['name_of_key']

- to check currenly available keys run:
    for key in sim.logs.iterkeys():
        print key

LOGGING DATA NAMING CONVENTION:
 - S_ prefix - system state vector variables
 - R_ prefix - roll regulator
 - L1_ prefix - L1 navigation regulator

COORDINATE FRAME CONVENTION

Sim coordinate frame convention:
 - Y is North
 - X is East
 - phi is measured from Y to the right (normal heading convention)
 - this simplifies the use of plotting modules

APM coordinate frame convention:
 - NED:
    > X is North
    > Y is East
    > Z is Down
